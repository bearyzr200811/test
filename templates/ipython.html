<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">  ' Paula Radcliffe will compete in the Flora London Marathon this year after deciding her schedule for 2005.  The 31-year-old won the race in 2002 on her marathon debut, defended her title 12 months later and will now seek a third title in the 17 April race. &quot;It doesn\'t get any better than this for the 25th anniversary,&quot; said race director David Bedford. &quot;After announcing the greatest men\'s field ever we now have the greatest women\'s distance runner ever.&quot; Three years ago Radcliffe smashed the women\'s world record in two hours 18 minutes 15 seconds.  The Bedford star returned to London 12 months later, lowering her mixed-race world record of 2:17:18, which she set in Chicago in October 2003, by one minute 53 secs. Radcliffe\'s career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the &quot;Big City&quot; marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. &quot;Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,&quot; said Radcliffe. &quot;I don\'t pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. &quot;I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. &quot;It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.&quot; ',</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">  ' Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.  The 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. &quot;It\'s nothing serious,&quot; said his coach Peter Stanley. &quot;He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.&quot; Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season\'s best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month\'s European Indoor Championships.  Lewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season\'s best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second. ',</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">  'Chelsea denied by James heroics',</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">  &quot; A brave defensive display, led by keeper David James, helped Manchester City hold the leaders Chelsea.  After a quiet opening, James denied Damien Duff, Jiri Jarosik and Mateja Kezman, while Paul Bosvelt cleared William Gallas' header off the line. Robbie Fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. Chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but James kept out Frank Lampard's free-kick and superbly tipped the same player's volley wide. City went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat Chelsea this season. And there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as Chelsea - deprived of Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. Indeed, it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. Shaun Wright-Phillips - watched by England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball, which was blocked by John Terry. But Chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. First, Duff got round Ben Thatcher and blasted in a shot that James parried to Kezman, who turned the ball wide.  Soon afterwards, Jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head Lampard's corner goalwards but James tipped the ball over. Chelsea were now looking more like Premiership leaders and James kept out Kezman's fierce drive before Bosvelt and James combined to clear Gallas' header from Duff's corner. City broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in Fowler celebrating his 150th Premiership goal. Wright-Phillips raced down the left and crossed to Fowler but City's lone man up front, left free by Terry's slip, contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. The second half started as quietly as the first, although James was forced to divert a cross from the lively Duff away from Eidur Gudjohnsen's path. There was a nasty moment for Petr Cech, looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league, when a series of ricochets saw Fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the Czech Republic stopper. Another quiet spell followed, which Duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by Bosvelt. Lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and James somehow blocked it with his legs. Another timely challenge, this time from Richard Dunne in time added on, prevented Gudjohnsen from getting in a shot. There was still time for James to produce a sensational save to tip Lampard's volley round the post.  Cech, Paulo Ferreira, Gallas, Terry, Bridge, Jarosik (Tiago 56), Lampard, Makelele, Duff, Gudjohnsen, Kezman (Cole 63).  Subs Not Used: Johnson, Smertin, Cudicini.  Makelele, Gudjohnsen.

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">  'Bridge could miss rest of season',</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">  ' Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle.  The England international, 24, was hurt in an innocuous challenge with Alan Shearer during the Londoners\' FA Cup defeat at Newcastle on Sunday. &quot;We think it\'s a big injury,&quot; said Jose Mourinho, whose Chelsea team this week meet Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool in the Carling Cup final. William Gallas and Damien Duff could also miss the Barcelona game. France defender Gallas and Ireland winger Duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of Chelsea\'s 1-0 defeat at St James\' Park.  With Bridge having gone off after Mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus Carlo Cudicini\'s red card meant Chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. Cudicini would not have played against Barcelona, but had been promised a game in the Carling Cup final, although he will now miss the Cardiff showpiece through suspension. The manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to Barcelona, even though he has few options to replace Bridge at left-back.  Celestine Babayaro left the club in January, ironically to join Newcastle, and although Gallas has deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself. It could be that Paulo Ferreira, usually a right-back, is switched to left-back with Glen Johnson, who ended the Newcastle game in goal, playing on the right. Youngsters Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan and Sam Tillen would be options should Mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a Champions League tie. Bridge\'s injury also means Mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season.  &quot;He (Bridge) has no chance of playing against Barcelona, probably will not play against Liverpool (in the Carling Cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season,&quot; he said. &quot;The medical department will try to do everything to recover Gallas and Duff. We will have to wait and see, but I won\'t cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on Tuesday.&quot; Shearer said he was unsure what caused Bridge\'s injury. &quot;I don\'t know what happened.&quot; he said. &quot;It was just a shame. I don\'t think we even touched each other. &quot;By all accounts it\'s pretty serious. I went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best.&quot; Mourinho, whose team are chasing three trophies, has already lost winger Arjen Robben to a serious injury. ',</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">  ' Kieron Dyer smashed home the winner to end Bolton\'s 10-game unbeaten run.  Lee Bowyer put Newcastle ahead when he fed Stephen Carr on the right flank, then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross. Wanderers hit back through Stelios Giannakopoulos, who ended a fluid passing move with a well-struck volley. But Dyer had the last word in a game of few chances, pouncing on a loose ball after Alan Shearer\'s shot was blocked and firing into the top corner. Neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game, with plenty of tackles flying in, but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by. Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out Shearer\'s low shot and Dyer\'s close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note. And it was almost out of nothing that the Magpies took the lead on 35 minutes. Bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out Carr to his right. He then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met Carr\'s cross with a downward header into the far corner. Bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well.  They were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from Giannakopoulos. Jay-Jay Okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving Kevin Davies and Gary Speed, the Greek striker found the bottom corner with a first-time strike. The Magpies were opened up again before half-time as Davies set Giannakopoulos in space and Given had to block at his near post. But the home side survived, and they should have re-taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half. Fernando Hierro cynically chopped down Dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through. But the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby, and from the resultant free-kick Laurent Robert curled the ball just wide. Bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the Magpies. Their strategy seemed to be working until the 69th minute. Alan Shearer\'s snap-shot was charged down and Dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing Jaaskelainen from six yards.  - Bolton boss Sam Allardyce &quot;I am bitterly disappointed with the result, but I am probably more disappointed with the second-half performance. &quot;In the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure, and our goal matched theirs in quality. &quot;I thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games, but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half. &quot;We allowed them to heap too much pressure on us, and in the end we cracked.&quot;   - Newcastle boss Graeme Souness &quot;We deserved the win. We had a really good second half. &quot;Bolton are a difficult side to play. You have to match them physically first but we did that, and then we played some football. &quot;We had a slow first 45 minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that. The scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals.&quot; Newcastle: Given, Carr, Boumsong, Bramble, Babayaro, Dyer, Faye, Bowyer, Robert (Jenas 77), Ameobi, Shearer.

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">  'What now for British tennis?',</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">  ' Tim Henman\'s decision to quit Davis Cup tennis has left the British team with a gargantuan void to fill.  The world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament (he has 36 from his 50 rubbers). And Great Britain\'s last Davis Cup win without Henman came against Slovenia as far back as 1996. Worse could follow, according to former British team member Chris Bailey. Bailey told BBC Sport: &quot;After Tim\'s announcement, I doubt Greg Rusedski will be that far behind him.&quot; But without their top two, where does that leave British ambitions in the sport\'s premier team event? Captain Jeremy Bates has singled out Alex Bogdanovic and Andrew Murray as potential replacements. The Yugoslavian-born Bogdanovic, though, is 184 places below Henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other.  Murray, on the other hand, is 407th in the current ATP entry list and yet to make his cup debut. But Bailey does see some hope for the future. He said: &quot;Now we\'ve dropped down to the Euro-Africa zone, the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore.&quot; Britain\'s next opponents, Israel, are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4-6 March match against a likely trio of Bogdanovic, Murray and the 187th-ranked Arvind Parmar. Bailey said: &quot;It will be tough for GB to move up, but there comes a time when our young players have to step up. This was always going to be inevitable with Tim and Greg\'s growing years. &quot;I\'m confident about the future. I wouldn\'t lay money on us getting back into the world group next year, but I\'d imagine in five years time we\'ll be competing for the major honours.&quot; Of those lining up to replace Henman, the 17-year-old Murray, with four Futures titles under his belt last year, looks the best long-term bet. &quot;Murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over Tim\'s mantle,&quot; said Bailey. &quot;He has an enormous amount of self-confidence, judging by what he\'s said in the past.&quot; Bogdanovic, three years Murray\'s senior, has had a more troubled time under Britain\'s Davis Cup umbrella.  While Murray has been marked out as Britain\'s golden boy, Bogdanovic was warned by the Lawn Tennis Association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003. And Bailey said: &quot;Despite that, Alex is clearly talented as well, while Arvind is another contender. &quot;They\'re among the guys who have experienced the intensity of Davis Cup tennis - whether as players or on the sidelines. &quot;The LTA has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that. &quot;Now they\'ll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup. And I\'m confident that will springboard Team GB to greater success.&quot; ',</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">  ' Tough-scrummaging prop Julian White is expecting a resurgent Wales to give him a rough ride in England\'s Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday.  The Leicester tight-head is in the form of his life, making the England number three shirt his own. But he knows Wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny. &quot;The Welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with,&quot; he told BBC Sport. &quot;They have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years.&quot; White is also impressed with the Welsh pack\'s strength in depth. &quot;Gethin Jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. He has played a bit at tight-head but I think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good,&quot; he added. The 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the England and Leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.  He destroyed South Africa\'s Os du Randt in the scrum at Twickenham last autumn to give England the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory. Leicester, who signed White from Bristol when the West Country side were relegated from the Zurich Premiership in the summer of 2003, have also been aided by White\'s presence this season. The Tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the Premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the Heineken Cup. &quot;I am pleased with my form,&quot; he said. &quot;But my form is helped by the people I play with at Leicester - people like Martin Johnson and Graham Rowntree. &quot;It\'s been a good season so far and to be in the starting XV for the first game of the Six Nations is what every player wants. &quot;I am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend.&quot; White is now one of the more experienced members of the England squad which takes to the field on Saturday. Injuries have taken their toll and coach Andy Robinson has been deprived of Richard Hill, Jonny Wilkinson, Martin Corry, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood and Stuart Abbott.  And with 27 caps and a World Cup winner\'s medal to his name, White is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres Matthew Tait and Jamie Noon. &quot;I don\'t know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way,&quot; he added. &quot;When I first came into the squad, people like Jason Leonard and Martin Johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.  &quot;It gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you. &quot;I was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good.&quot; White missed the vast majority of last year\'s Six Nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going. And that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in Cardiff. &quot;I enjoy the atmosphere. The Millennium Stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;To go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - it\'s one of my favourite places to play. &quot;This is probably the most even Six Nations for a long time. England, Ireland, France and Wales are all contenders. &quot;On form, Ireland should be favourites but you just don\'t know - that\'s the great thing about this tournament.&quot; ',</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"> ' Musicians\' groups are to tackle US visa regulations which are blamed for hindering British acts\' chances of succeeding across the Atlantic.  A singer hoping to perform in the US can expect to pay $1,300 (Â£680) simply for obtaining a visa. Groups including the Musicians\' Union are calling for an end to the &quot;raw deal&quot; faced by British performers. US acts are not faced with comparable expense and bureaucracy when visiting the UK for promotional purposes.  Nigel McCune from the Musicians\' Union said British musicians are &quot;disadvantaged&quot; compared to their US counterparts. A sponsor has to make a petition on their behalf, which is a form amounting to nearly 30 pages, while musicians face tougher regulations than athletes and journalists. &quot;If you make a mistake on your form, you risk a five-year ban and thus the ability to further your career,&quot; says Mr McCune.  &quot;The US is the world\'s biggest music market, which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy,&quot; says Mr McCune. &quot;The current situation is preventing British acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the US,&quot; he added.  The Musicians\' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers\' Forum (MMF), who say British artists face &quot;an uphill struggle&quot; to succeed in the US, thanks to the tough visa requirements, which are also seen as impractical. The MMF\'s general secretary James Seller said: &quot;Imagine if you were an orchestra from the Orkneys? Every member would have to travel to London to have their visas processed.&quot;  &quot;The US market is seen as the holy grail and one of the benchmarks of success, and we\'re still going to fight to get in there. &quot;It\'s still very important, but there are other markets like Europe, India and China,&quot; added Mr Seller. A Department for Media, Culture and Sport spokeswoman said: &quot;We\'re aware that people are experiencing problems, and are working with the US embassy and record industry to see what we can do about it.&quot; A US Embassy spokesman said: &quot;We are aware that entertainers require visas for time-specific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily.&quot; &quot;We are aware of the importance of cultural exchange and we will do our best to facilitate that,&quot; he added.

A sponsor has to make a petition on their behalf, which is a form amounting to nearly 30 pages, while musicians face tougher regulations than athletes and journalists. &quot;If you make a mistake on your form, you risk a five-year ban and thus the ability to further your career,&quot; says Mr McCune.  &quot;The US is the world\'s biggest music market, which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy,&quot; says Mr McCune. &quot;The current situation is preventing British acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the US,&quot; he added.  The Musicians\' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers\' Forum (MMF), who say British artists face &quot;an uphill struggle&quot; to succeed in the US, thanks to the tough visa requirements, which are also seen as impractical. The MMF\'s general secretary James Seller said: &quot;Imagine if you were an orchestra from the Orkneys? Every member would have to travel to London to have their visas processed.&quot;  &quot;The US market is seen as the holy grail and one of the benchmarks of success, and we\'re still going to fight to get in there. &quot;It\'s still very important, but there are other markets like Europe, India and China,&quot; added Mr Seller. A Department for Media, Culture and Sport spokeswoman said: &quot;We\'re aware that people are experiencing problems, and are working with the US embassy and record industry to see what we can do about it.&quot; A US Embassy spokesman said: &quot;We are aware that entertainers require visas for time-specific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily.&quot; &quot;We are aware of the importance of cultural exchange and we will do our best to facilitate that,&quot; he added.

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"> 'Musicians to tackle US red tape',</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"> ' Musicians\' groups are to tackle US visa regulations which are blamed for hindering British acts\' chances of succeeding across the Atlantic.  A singer hoping to perform in the US can expect to pay $1,300 (Â£680) simply for obtaining a visa. Groups including the Musicians\' Union are calling for an end to the &quot;raw deal&quot; faced by British performers. US acts are not faced with comparable expense and bureaucracy when visiting the UK for promotional purposes.  Nigel McCune from the Musicians\' Union said British musicians are &quot;disadvantaged&quot; compared to their US counterparts. A sponsor has to make a petition on their behalf, which is a form amounting to nearly 30 pages, while musicians face tougher regulations than athletes and journalists. &quot;If you make a mistake on your form, you risk a five-year ban and thus the ability to further your career,&quot; says Mr McCune.  &quot;The US is the world\'s biggest music market, which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy,&quot; says Mr McCune. &quot;The current situation is preventing British acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the US,&quot; he added.  The Musicians\' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers\' Forum (MMF), who say British artists face &quot;an uphill struggle&quot; to succeed in the US, thanks to the tough visa requirements, which are also seen as impractical. The MMF\'s general secretary James Seller said: &quot;Imagine if you were an orchestra from the Orkneys? Every member would have to travel to London to have their visas processed.&quot;  &quot;The US market is seen as the holy grail and one of the benchmarks of success, and we\'re still going to fight to get in there. &quot;It\'s still very important, but there are other markets like Europe, India and China,&quot; added Mr Seller. A Department for Media, Culture and Sport spokeswoman said: &quot;We\'re aware that people are experiencing problems, and are working with the US embassy and record industry to see what we can do about it.&quot; A US Embassy spokesman said: &quot;We are aware that entertainers require visas for time-specific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily.&quot; &quot;We are aware of the importance of cultural exchange and we will do our best to facilitate that,&quot; he added.

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">   'Franz man seeks government help',</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">   ' Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos has called for more government help for musicians, while taking part in an Edinburgh Lectures discussion.  &quot;For any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well,&quot; he said. But Kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with MPs, at the University of Edinburgh event. &quot;I think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them,&quot; he said.  Kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss Scotland\'s role in making 21st Century music. &quot;There are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they aren\'t self-sufficient,&quot; he said. &quot;But so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well.&quot; He warned musicians against being allied to a particular party, however. &quot;I don\'t know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea.&quot;  Kapranos and his Glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week\'s Brit Awards, including best group and best album. Their self-titled debut album won last year\'s Mercury Music Prize and spawned three top 20 singles. He told the 300-strong audience at the University\'s Reid Hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes. &quot;We say \'I like this\'. Because I listen to Nirvana and Korn I am a troubled individual, I\'m riddled with angst because I listen to Chopin and Debussy, I listen to Kylie Minogue and Scissor Sisters because I\'m upbeat and I like to party, I listen to Wagner because I like the smell of napalm in the morning.&quot; Kapranos said there was a general &quot;hostility&quot; towards classical music, adding: &quot;There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM.&quot;  He concluded: &quot;We define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity.&quot; Fellow speaker and classical composer James MacMillan agreed: &quot;We need to rediscover our ability to listen.&quot; Previous speakers at the Edinburgh Lectures series have included former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and author Professor Stephen Hawking. Kapranos described his appearance on Wednesday as &quot;more daunting by a long way&quot; than their upcoming Brits performance. &quot;I don\'t really care about the Brits,&quot; he said. &quot;It\'s going to be great to go down but I have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight.&quot;  I think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues. Also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels.  Rather than expecting the government - i.e. the taxpayer - to fork out, why don\'t some of the megastars put something back in? Some of Britain\'s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc. There are far more important demands on government funds.  If they can fund football, why not fund music?  Areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music? We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. The only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.  The government has enough problems funding schools and health services. If Alex Kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.  As a Scot living in England, I appreciate the value of Scottish music and culture being a success, so I can see no problem with it! Franz Ferdinand, Travis and Snow Patrol are just recent examples of the success Scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we Scots are good at and support our own goods!  I think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state? The answer is most definitely no. Those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn\'t be looking for government subsidies. I know that if I was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping I would want to finance myself until I was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.  Yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.  There are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the &quot;new deal&quot;. Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.  As long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move. I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.  Only if the proposals make financial sense. Franz Ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they\'d had a government grant to get started they\'d have more than paid it back by now, so the Treasury would be making far more than it paid out. However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they\'re a musician. The government shouldn\'t &quot;fund&quot; music - it should &quot;invest&quot; in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.  I think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. The equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. However, I do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.  I do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! They generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn\'t have to fork out a great deal.  Yeah, why not? Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities  I agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. Call it a tax on music &quot;pollution&quot;, if you like.  Though I really like Franz Ferdinand, I have to disagree with Mr Kapranos. Once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like Save the Music in the US. ',</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">   'Parents face video game lessons',</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">   ' Ways of ensuring that parents know which video games are suitable for children are to be considered by the games industry.  The issue was discussed at a meeting between UK government officials, industry representatives and the British Board of Film Classification. It follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. In 2003, Britons spent Â£1,152m on games, more than ever before. And this Christmas, parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles.  Violent games have been hit by controversy after the game Manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in Leicester in February. His mother, Giselle, said her son\'s killer, Warren Leblanc, 17 - who was jailed for life in September - had mimicked behaviour in the game.  Police investigating Stefan\'s murder dismissed its influence and said Manhunt was not part of its legal case. The issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on Sunday by Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt. This was the focus of the talks between government officials, representatives from the games industry and the British Board of Film Classification. &quot;Adults can make informed choices about what games to play. Children can\'t and they deserve to be protected,&quot; said Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell after the meeting. &quot;Industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn\'t play.&quot; Roger Bennett, director general of Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, said: &quot;A number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting. &quot;They will be formulated to create specific proposals to promote greater understanding, recognition and awareness of the games rating system, ensuring that young people are not exposed to inappropriate content.&quot;  Among the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience, as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves.  According to industry statistics, a majority of players are over 18, with the average age of a gamer being 29. Academics point out that there has not been any definitive research linking bloodthirsty games such as Manhunt with violent responses in players. In a report published this week for the Video Standards Council, Dr Guy Cumberbatch said: &quot;The research evidence on media violence causing harm to viewers is wildly exaggerated and does not stand up to scrutiny.&quot; Dr Cumberbatch, head of the social policy think tank, the Communications Research Group, reviewed the studies on the issue. He concluded that there was an absence of convincing research that media violence caused harm. ',</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">   'What the election should really be about?',</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">   &quot; A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. Here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected Spring poll.  We've called for the state pension to be increased from Â£79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of Â£105.45. That's what we're calling for. Many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system. If we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.  We've drawn up a pensioners' manifesto. This will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies. They will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support. Once we've got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. It's our way of putting the politicians on notice. We are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. Before 1997 most pensioners voted Conservative. In 1997 and 2001 they voted Labour. But there is no guarantee they will vote for a Labour government this time around. They cannot take that vote for granted.  Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue. He said the UK had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world.  That the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment.  We haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs. Various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing. We don't have any large demonstrations planned but they can't be ruled out.  It is hard to say whether we will be successful. We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq.  Repealing the Hunting Bill.  We are challenging the use of the Parliament Act 1949 in a High Court action. We are hoping to hear in the New Year. Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. When the ban comes into force on 18 February we will be going to the European Court because no compensation is being paid. So there's a lot of legal territory to go. We are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. Whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (Rural affairs minister) Alun Michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. It is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. Of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything.  It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face. It's exactly what the prime minister did not want. He wanted the issue off the table until after the election.  People using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. The reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. It is another sort of form of shooting for sport. The principle is the same whether it's a tiger or a pheasant.  We will widely publicise what's happening in relation to trophy hunting. We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK. We will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors. With hunting we had many MPs who were happy to say they were against it.  I think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. Whether or not we will get a ban I am not sure. But it will mobilise public opinion. Everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.  The issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice. The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. Choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. It's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that. Choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. We have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. We want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.  Firstly, we have our website. It features our campaigns and changes every day. Secondly through our 700,000 members who communicate with us. Thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. We will invite the opinion formers, MPs, journalists and others. The idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians.  I think we will be successful. It's very much the language being used by the main political parties. Politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.  Fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. We have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that Gordon Brown has been postponing and postponing. Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about Â£750. If you're running 10 vehicles it's obviously 10 times that.  If fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. There will be a huge effect throughout the industry and I would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. What it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business.  We will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press. Regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. Whatever we do, the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority. But they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work, when you see a lorry it's already at work. &quot;,</p>

Ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. Details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. Labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday\'s figures offer a progress check. They will say that in the past year more than 2,600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.  Police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders, breaking up groups of youths in public places. The 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. Exeter and Cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.  Prime Minister Tony Blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of Asbos and fixed penalty notices. There are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.  He is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. &quot;We have not defeated this problem by any means, but shown together what can be done,&quot; he will say. Mr Blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws, saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.  Ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (CSOs). But researchers from Leeds University warned that CSOs could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. More work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before CSOs, they argued in a the study. Critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. Home Office Minister Hazel Blears also revealed this week that &quot;about a third&quot; of Asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not. ',</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">   ' Anyone planning to move to the UK will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said.  He is proposing a points system similar to Australia\'s but would avoid the quota system planned by the Tories. Mr Clarke, who will unveil his plans on Monday, said economic migration helped the UK but &quot;needed proper policing&quot;. The Lib Dems say they will look at his plans, but Tory Liam Fox said his party offered a &quot;clear choice&quot; on the issue. The Conservative Party Co-Chairman said the British electorate had a choice between a Labour government that had &quot;done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit&quot; on immigration and a Tory one that would impose quotas.  The home secretary said, by 2008, he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the UK to have their fingerprints taken, to &quot;ensure we can know everybody who is in the country&quot;. Speaking on BBC One\'s Breakfast with Frost, he said &quot;economic migrants are of great value to this country&quot;, but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a &quot;burden on society&quot;. He said: &quot;We will establish a system ... which looks at the skills, talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country, and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.&quot;  The home secretary, whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on Monday, also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry. &quot;The issue of who does come into this country, and whether they are entitled to be in this country, who does settle here, how we have border controls, is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate,&quot; he said. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: &quot;Whilst it is good that Labour has rejected the Tory idea of quotas on asylum, the jury is still out on the Home Office\'s ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.&quot;  Mr Howard has said Britain should take its fair share of the world\'s &quot;genuine refugees&quot;. But he claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain\'s generosity. Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, called on Mr Clarke to denounce the suggestion Britain\'s hospitality was being tested by immigration. &quot;Tell that to the 44,000 doctors in the NHS and the 70,000 nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means,&quot; he said. &quot;Ditto the teachers, from South Africa, Australia, Jamaica, who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools.&quot; The Refugee Council said Mr Howard\'s proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the UK.

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"> 'Franz man seeks government help',</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"> ' Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos has called for more government help for musicians, while taking part in an Edinburgh Lectures discussion.  &quot;For any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well,&quot; he said. But Kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with MPs, at the University of Edinburgh event. &quot;I think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them,&quot; he said.  Kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss Scotland\'s role in making 21st Century music. &quot;There are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they aren\'t self-sufficient,&quot; he said. &quot;But so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well.&quot; He warned musicians against being allied to a particular party, however. &quot;I don\'t know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea.&quot;  Kapranos and his Glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week\'s Brit Awards, including best group and best album. Their self-titled debut album won last year\'s Mercury Music Prize and spawned three top 20 singles. He told the 300-strong audience at the University\'s Reid Hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes. &quot;We say \'I like this\'. Because I listen to Nirvana and Korn I am a troubled individual, I\'m riddled with angst because I listen to Chopin and Debussy, I listen to Kylie Minogue and Scissor Sisters because I\'m upbeat and I like to party, I listen to Wagner because I like the smell of napalm in the morning.&quot; Kapranos said there was a general &quot;hostility&quot; towards classical music, adding: &quot;There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM.&quot;  He concluded: &quot;We define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity.&quot; Fellow speaker and classical composer James MacMillan agreed: &quot;We need to rediscover our ability to listen.&quot; Previous speakers at the Edinburgh Lectures series have included former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and author Professor Stephen Hawking. Kapranos described his appearance on Wednesday as &quot;more daunting by a long way&quot; than their upcoming Brits performance. &quot;I don\'t really care about the Brits,&quot; he said. &quot;It\'s going to be great to go down but I have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight.&quot;  I think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues. Also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels.  Rather than expecting the government - i.e. the taxpayer - to fork out, why don\'t some of the megastars put something back in? Some of Britain\'s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc. There are far more important demands on government funds.  If they can fund football, why not fund music?  Areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music? We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. The only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.  The government has enough problems funding schools and health services. If Alex Kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.  As a Scot living in England, I appreciate the value of Scottish music and culture being a success, so I can see no problem with it! Franz Ferdinand, Travis and Snow Patrol are just recent examples of the success Scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we Scots are good at and support our own goods!  I think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state? The answer is most definitely no. Those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn\'t be looking for government subsidies. I know that if I was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping I would want to finance myself until I was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.  Yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.  There are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the &quot;new deal&quot;. Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.  As long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move. I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.  Only if the proposals make financial sense. Franz Ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they\'d had a government grant to get started they\'d have more than paid it back by now, so the Treasury would be making far more than it paid out. However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they\'re a musician. The government shouldn\'t &quot;fund&quot; music - it should &quot;invest&quot; in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.  I think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. The equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. However, I do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.  I do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! They generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn\'t have to fork out a great deal.  Yeah, why not? Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities  I agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. Call it a tax on music &quot;pollution&quot;, if you like.  Though I really like Franz Ferdinand, I have to disagree with Mr Kapranos. Once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like Save the Music in the US. ',</p>

I know that if I was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping I would want to finance myself until I was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.  Yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.  There are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the &quot;new deal&quot;. Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.  As long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move. I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.  Only if the proposals make financial sense. Franz Ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they\'d had a government grant to get started they\'d have more than paid it back by now, so the Treasury would be making far more than it paid out. However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they\'re a musician. The government shouldn\'t &quot;fund&quot; music - it should &quot;invest&quot; in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.  I think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. The equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. However, I do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.  I do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! They generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn\'t have to fork out a great deal.  Yeah, why not? Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities  I agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. Call it a tax on music &quot;pollution&quot;, if you like.  Though I really like Franz Ferdinand, I have to disagree with Mr Kapranos. Once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like Save the Music in the US. ',</p>
